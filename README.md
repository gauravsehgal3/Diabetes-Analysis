# Diabetes-Analysis
The Diabetes Analysis project is designed to explore and analyze diabetes data to derive meaningful insights and predictions. By applying various data science and machine learning techniques, this project aims to identify key factors influencing diabetes and develop models to predict potential health outcomes for patients.

# Objectives
	•	Data Exploration: Gain a thorough understanding of the dataset’s structure and characteristics.
	•	Data Cleaning: Address missing values, handle outliers, and normalize data to prepare it for analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Create visualizations to identify trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
	•	Feature Engineering: Develop new features that enhance the predictive power of the models.
	•	Model Building: Construct and train machine learning models to predict diabetes-related outcomes.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	•	Insights & Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to aid in diabetes management and prevention.
