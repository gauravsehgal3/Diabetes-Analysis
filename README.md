# Diabetes-Analysis
This project involves the analysis of diabetes data using Python. The aim is to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and evaluate their performance. This project can be useful for healthcare professionals and researchers to gain insights into diabetes and to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical parameters.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-analysis.git
    cd diabetes-analysis
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains medical data of patients along with a label indicating whether or not each patient has diabetes. The dataset file `diabetes.csv` should be placed in the `data/` directory.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the data. The preprocessing steps are documented in the `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook and implemented in `src/preprocess.py`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is performed to understand the distribution and relationships of the features in the dataset. Visualizations and statistical analysis are done using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The EDA steps are documented in the `02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook and implemented in `src/analysis.py`.

## Model Building
Several machine learning models are built to predict diabetes. These include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The model building process is documented in the `03_model_building.ipynb` notebook and implemented in `src/models.py`.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation steps are documented in the `04_model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook and implemented in `src/evaluation.py`.

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Ensure that the data is placed in the `data/` directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to execute the analysis step-by-step.
3. Alternatively, use the scripts in the `src/` directory to perform specific tasks.
